The 5 points of TULIP are one of the foundations of Reformed theology, but they are also controversial among many Christians today, and can lead to more emotional than biblical arguments against this doctrine. In this page, we will shortly see what the different points are and how the Bible talks about them.
## T : Total Depravity

The point of total depravity teaches that man, in his nature, is corrupted by sin and is incapable of saving himself.

This point affirms the doctrine of original sin, which says that man is sinful by nature since the sin of Adam.

Romans 3:10b-18 tells us this:

>[!bibleverse]- Romans 3:10b-18
><span style="color:#5a708a">*“There is none righteous, not even one;<br/>There is none who understands,<br/>There is none who seeks for God;<br/>All have turned aside, together they have become useless;<br/>There is none who does good,<br/>There is not even one.”<br/>“Their throat is an open grave,<br/>With their tongues they keep deceiving,”<br/>“The poison of asps is under their lips”;<br/>“Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness”;<br/>“Their feet are swift to shed blood,<br/>Destruction and misery are in their paths,<br/>And the path of peace they have not known.”<br/>“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”*</span>

No one of us is good, and we are not able to save ourselves because of our nature. In our sinful nature, we have no desire of seeking God and we love our sins.

There are other passages to affirm this idea of total depravity, that you can see below:

>[!bibleverse]- Romans 3:23
> <span style="color:#5a708a">*for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,*</span>

> [!bibleverse]- Ephesians 2:1-3
> <span style="color:#5a708a">*And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,<br/>in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.<br/>Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.*</span>

This means that we are not able to come to God by our own choice. For as we have no desire to seek God, we will have no true willingness to choose to live for Him.

The good deeds that we can do in our life do not guarantee us entry into paradise either, because they are tainted by our sin.

> [!bibleverse]- Isaiah 64:6
> <span style="color:#5a708a">*For all of us have become like one who is unclean,<br/>And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment;<br/>And all of us wither like a leaf,<br/>And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.*</span>

Now that we know this, how can we be saved?

## U : Unconditional Election

God, in His grace, chose before the foundation of the world a group of people who will be sanctified before Him and live their lives in obedience to Him.

This choice is made, not because of anything we ourselves have, but for the good pleasure of our Lord.

> [!bibleverse]- Ephesians 1:4-6
> <span style="color:#5a708a">*just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love<br/>He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,<br/>to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.*</span>

> [!bibleverse]- Romans 8:28-30
><span style="color:#5a708a"> *And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.<br/>For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren;<br/>and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.*</span>

The purpose of election is to justify sinners who are dead in their sins and to give them life. This is a grace that God has given us, otherwise we would remain dead and we would be heading more and more towards hell.

## L : Limited Atonement

This is the most controversial point of TULIP. It teaches that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross was made to save the elect and only the elect.

Indeed, salvation was not for everyone, and for one to be able to “choose” to come to Him, as we have seen that is not possible ([[#t--total-depravity|see the point discussed above]]), but for the effective salvation of the people of God.

Here are some passages that could prove this:

> [!bibleverse]- Matthew 1:21
><span style="color:#5a708a"> *"She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins."*</span>

> [!bibleverse]- John 10:26-30
><span style="color:#5a708a"> *"But you do not believe because you are not of My sheep.<br/>"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;<br/>and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.<br/>"My Father, who has given [them] to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch [them] out of the Father's hand.<br/>"I and the Father are one."*</span>

> [!bibleverse]- John 17:7-10
><span style="color:#5a708a"> *"Now they have come to know that everything You have given Me is from You;<br/>for the words which You gave Me I have given to them; and they received [them] and truly understood that I came forth from You, and they believed that You sent Me.<br/>"I ask on their behalf; I do not ask on behalf of the world, but of those whom You have given Me; for they are Yours;<br/>and all things that are Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I have been glorified in them.*</span>

Would Christ have died for everyone despite the fact that many will never believe in Him? If this is the case, Christ is only a potential savior, and so God would not have been successful in saving some people.

## I : Irresistible Grace

God causes His elect to come to Him by regenerating them through the work of the Holy Spirit, and will thus bring them to Him according to His will.

Since we have no inclination to come to God by our nature, God Himself accomplishes the renewal of our lives.

> [!bibleverse]- John 5:21
><span style="color:#5a708a"> *"For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes.*</span>

> [!bibleverse]- John 6:44
><span style="color:#5a708a"> *"No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day.*</span>

This act is necessary for a dead man to come to life, and all this is accomplished according to the will of God.

## P : Perseverance of the Saints

Finally, this last point teaches that God keeps the elect until the end. What the Lord has begun in us, he will bring to fruition.

Indeed, despite the many faults that we may commit towards God in our lives, nothing will separate us from Him, because it is not on us that the task of saving rests, but on God.

> [!bibleverse]- Romans 8:35-39
><span style="color:#5a708a"> *Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?<br/>Just as it is written, "FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE BEING PUT TO DEATH ALL DAY LONG; WE WERE CONSIDERED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED."<br/>But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us.<br/>For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers<br/>nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.*</span>

> [!bibleverse]- John 3:16
><span style="color:#5a708a"> *"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have <span style="font-weight:bold">eternal life</span>.*</span>
