Last month was Pride Month, and it was a month in which all kinds of abominations were promoted. We have reached a point where some identify as “gay Christians.” These people see no problem in being homosexual and Christian at the same time, without understanding the problems of this lifestyle. This article is intended to give sufficient evidence for Christians to know why they cannot practice a homosexual lifestyle.

## Homosexuality in the Bible

The Bible speaks of homosexuality in several passages in the Old Testament. We will see some of them in the book of Leviticus:

>[!bibleverse]- Leviticus 18:22
> <span style="color:#5a708a">*You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.*</span>

>[!bibleverse]- Leviticus 20:13
> <span style="color:#5a708a">*If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them*</span>

We see in these 2 passages that in the old covenant, homosexuality was condemned by God as an abomination and punishable by death. But you should know that the New Testament also has things to say regarding homosexuality, as we see in the following passages:

>[!bibleverse]- Romans 1:26-28
> <span style="color:#5a708a">*For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural,<br/>and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.<br/>And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper*</span>

> [!bibleverse]- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10
> <span style="color:#5a708a">*Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals,<br/>nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.*</span>

We see that the 2 Testaments speak of homosexuality as being a sin and an abomination in the sight of God. But why this?

You should know that God designed sexuality to be between a man and a woman, so this is valid for all romantic relationships. Having a romantic relationship between two people of the same sex is not only against God's original design, but it is also a clear disobedience to what the Bible teaches regarding the sin of homosexuality.

>[!bibleverse]- Genesis 2:24
> <span style="color:#5a708a">*For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.*</span>

## Arguments to defend homosexuality

There is of course always opposition regarding the biblical position on the sin of homosexuality, some of which I will address in this article.

### Jesus never said anything about homosexuality

The argument rests on the fact that Jesus never spoke about homosexuality in the Bible. But of course, this argument isn't valid, and I'll show you why.

First of all, you should know that the gospels do not serve to give the whole theology of our Lord Jesus Christ, but to show His life, why He died and what He accomplished on the Cross.

>[!bibleverse]- John 21:25
> <span style="color:#5a708a">*And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they were written in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that would be written.*</span>

To continue, the gospels have no more authority than the rest of the Bible. The whole Bible is God's Word revealed to us, and no book of the Bible is less inspired than the other.

>[!bibleverse]- 2 Timothy 3:16-17
> <span style="color:#5a708a">*All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;<br/>so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.*</span>

Finally, we must understand that Jesus is a member of The Trinity, Jesus is God.

>[!bibleverse]- John 1:1
> <span style="color:#5a708a">*In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.*</span>

This means that He has always been present and in agreement with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Jesus is the God of the Old Testament and the New Testament. This shows that Jesus was also the one who destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 19. We tend to dissociate Jesus from God, while at the same time we say that Jesus is God. Whereas if we truly believe that Jesus is God, we must also understand that He is the God of the Old Testament.

### You can't put the Bible above my relationship with Jesus

I found this argument in a video clip that I had seen. One woman said she was a "gay Christian" and was most filled with the Holy Spirit when she kissed another woman. She also said that no one could put the Bible above their relationship with Jesus, because that would make the Bible an idol. _Interesting._

One of the questions I asked myself when watching this video was this:<br/>_Which Jesus is this woman talking about?_

I am convinced that many people who want to call themselves "Christians" but at the same time oppose the commandments of the Bible end up, at some point, creating their own Jesus who lets them do what they want to do. Unbelievers love sin and are unwilling to give it up.

But why is the argument bad? The Bible is our standard for Truth. By using this argument we show that we have not understood how to have a relationship with God. Because it is through our regular reading of the Bible and prayer that we can have a relationship with God and also make it grow. One does not go without the other.

>[!bibleverse]- Romans 6:1-2
> <span style="color:#5a708a">*What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase?<br/>May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in it?*</span>

We can use the Bible to correct others, as the passage from 2 Timothy 3:16-17 cited above says. This does not make the Bible an idol because we, as Christians, are supposed to have a high view of the Bible, because the Word of God is the source of authority for the lives of Christians.

>[!bibleverse]- John 8:31-38
> <span style="color:#5a708a">*So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, “If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine;<br/>and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.”<br/>They answered Him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never yet been enslaved to anyone; how is it that You say, ‘You will become free’?”<br/>Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin.<br/>The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever.<br/>So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.<br/>I know that you are Abraham’s descendants; yet you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.<br/>I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; therefore you also do the things which you heard from your father.”*</span>

Those who therefore continue to live in sin are its slaves, but those who truly give their lives to Christ will be free from the chains of sin. We cannot therefore continue to call ourselves “Christian” and at the same time live in sin.
## To conclude

Homosexuality is therefore a sin condemned by God, and this sin leads to eternal suffering. But that doesn't mean those who commit it can't be forgiven. These people can repent of their sin and believe in the sacrifice of Jesus. They will thus be renewed.

We must pray for all people in this sin as well as for others who are also slaves to sin. I hope this article has been helpful to you in learning more about the sin of homosexuality, and that your faith can be strengthened by it.
